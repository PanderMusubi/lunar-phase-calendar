# lunar-phase-calendar

Roling ICS calendars with
[lunar phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase) for two years in
advance.

The calendars are generated for different languages and in the formats:
* tab-separated format in TSV files
* MarkDown in MD files
* iCalendar in ICS files

Besides calendars with all the lunars phases, there are also calendars provided
with only the dates when there is a full moon.

The calendar is generated on a certain day for two years in advance and is
published in this repository. At the time of generation, a margin is used of one
month at the beginning and of two months at the end. The calendar will be
regenerated regularly. In case the calendar is lagging behind too much or a
larger time span is desireable, please create an issue requesting that.

output files:
